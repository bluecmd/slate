## Transaction

An <code>account</code> usually contains multiple transactions (except for certain types of accounts where Tink can't access the underlying transactions, for example, certain <code>INVESTMENT</code> accounts). The <code>transaction</code> model represents any operations on an account, and could represent both the actual credit-card purchase on a <code>CREDIT_CARD</code> account, but also represent the transaction when you payed your credit-card bill. Most commonly, the transactions on an <code>account</code> should represent what the end-user typically.

The <code>payload</code> property can include arbitrary metadata which provided by the financial instituion in question that can be used either for deep-linking back to the financial institution's app, for displaying additional information about the transaction, or for backend purposes such as automatic categorization improvement, etc. It can also include metadata generated by Tink, for example, transfer transactions that are automatically flagged as transfers based on the identification of the corresponding transaction on the other account, includes the primary identifier of the peer transaction for easy access
