## User

The <code>user</code> model represents a unique Tink end-user and includes properties that defines the user, user profile information and user-modifiable settings. The <code>user</code> information can primarily be used whenever a Tink user signs up for a 3rd party service using her Tink account, or when user-modifiable settings, such as locale or currency, are needed in order to display or calculate the correct data in the 3rd party service.
