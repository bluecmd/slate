## User

When a customer wants to enrol a customer into Tink PFM, the customer needs to be activated as a user to Tink. To do this, a user object (user ID together with optional customer details) is sent to the <code>/user</code> endpoint.

After successful activation of a user, the customerâ€™s accounts can be created by calling the <code>/accounts</code> endpoint.
