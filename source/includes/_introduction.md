## Introduction

Welcome to the Tink API reference! This document explains how to work with our API and describes the data that you can access with it.

Before you start working with the Tink API, you must acquire the appropriate credentials as a 3rd-party API consumer in order to access the full set of functionallity. These credentials provides different levels of permissions, which determines what types of information that are shared with the 3rd-party API consumer. You can read more in the authentication section about the required credentials.

Please note that this document includes documentation of how to access general information from the Tink API. Selected partners that have specific OAuth2 permissions to modify data on behalf of the user are provided documentation on those specific topic separately.
